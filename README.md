**Aqara Advanced Lighting** is a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration that unlocks the full potential of **Aqara Ceiling Light T1M**, **Aqara LED Strip T1**, and **Aqara RGB & CCT bulbs T2** -- dynamic RGB effects, per-segment colors and gradients, animated sequences, multi-step color temperature transitions, dynamic scenes with music sync, circadian adaptive lighting, and more. All the features of the Aqara Home app and more, without an Aqara Hub.

Works with both **Zigbee2MQTT** and **ZHA** (Zigbee Home Automation).

## Features

**Lighting control** -- 13 dynamic RGB effects, per-segment colors and gradients, RGB segment sequences (up to 20 steps with 8 activation patterns), CCT sequences (up to 20 steps with standard, schedule, and solar modes), circadian lighting with sun-tracking and time-based schedules, dynamic scenes with slow color transitions across multiple lights, audio-reactive mode that makes lights respond to music in real time, pause/resume/stop control, change detection with per-attribute override tracking, and flexible segment selection.

**100+ presets** -- 20 effects, 12 segment patterns, 7 CCT sequences (including circadian, warm day, and productive day), 6 segment sequences, 58 dynamic scenes, 12 audio-reactive scenes. Create up to 250 custom presets per type (1,250 total) with the visual editors, back them up, and reuse them everywhere.

**Frontend panel** -- Sidebar-accessible UI with visual editors for every feature type, favorite lights, active presets monitoring with per-attribute override status, activation overrides, change detection settings, generic light configuration, T1 Strip music sync control, and per-device configuration.

**Dashboard card** -- A custom Lovelace card that puts your favorite presets on any dashboard. Configure one or more light entities, and the card displays compatible favorited presets as tappable buttons with thumbnails. Supports compact mode, configurable grid columns, preset name labels, user-preset highlighting, and real-time activation status. Add it from any dashboard via "Add Card" > search "Aqara Advanced Lighting Presets".

**Music sync mode** -- Dynamic lighting scenes and effects can respond to music via an ESP32 microphone running on-device FFT analysis and beat detection. Scene colors advance on beats or flow continuously with amplitude, effect speed can be synced to music. Adjustable sensitivity, transition speed, and brightness response. Runtime sensitivity slider for tuning while a scene is running. Can work alongside T1 Strip on-device audio sync. See the [audio-reactive setup guide](docs/audio-reactive-setup.md).

**Automations** -- 21 service actions, 22 device triggers, 8 device conditions, REST API trigger endpoint, light group support with automatic entity expansion, and multi-instance routing.

**Dual backend** -- Zigbee2MQTT and ZHA side by side, multiple Z2M instances, automatic device discovery, and cross-backend entity routing.
