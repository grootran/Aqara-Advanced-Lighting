# Changelog

All notable changes to the Aqara Advanced Lighting integration will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### What's New


Version 1.1.0 adds solar and schedule-based adaptive circadian CCT sequences, capability-aware light adaptation for any Home Assistant light, and a new more comprehensive override detection system.

### Features

#### **Schedule Mode for Adaptive CCT Sequences**

**Time-of-day schedule mode as an intuitive alternative to sun-elevation solar mode**

  - Schedule steps use fixed times (12:00) or sun-relative times (sunrise+30, sunset-60)
  - Solar timeline maps elevation to time using sinusoidal sun trajectory with real sunrise/sunset positions
  - Automatic interpolation between steps on a 24-hour cycle
  - Dual-track timeline preview showing color temperature and brightness with step markers
  - New backend services `start_circadian_mode` and `stop_circadian_mode`
  - Active circadian sequences persist across Home Assistant restarts

#### **Capability-Aware Light Adaptation**

**Imporved support for non-Aqara lights in dynamic scenes and CCT sequences**

  - Capability profiles classify lights as full-color, CCT-only, brightness-only, or on/off-only
  - Service calls adapted at runtime using XY-to-CCT conversion and color temp clamping
  - Software transition opt-in for non-Aqara lights via device config panel
  - Entity chips with capability badges on running scene cards

#### **Override Detection System**

**Context-based override detection with per-attribute control for solar and schedule sequences**

  - Service call listener detects overrides from EVENT_CALL_SERVICE data before state changes arrive
  - Context-only detection replaces grace window system -- integration commands tagged via Context(parent_id)
  - Per-attribute change detection with hardware drift tolerance (brightness delta <= 5, color_temp delta <= 50K)
  - Non-HA drift detection compares entity state against last-applied values with wider thresholds
  - Bare turn-on adaptation -- parameterized turn-on calls from off state override specified attributes while solar/schedule values fill the rest
  - Per-attribute pause indicators in frontend for all card types
  - Override detection controls split into a separate collapsible section in settings

#### **Solar CCT Persistence**

**Solar and schedule sequences now persist across Home Assistant restarts**

  - Running sequences preserved on shutdown and restored on startup after entities are registered
  - Per-instance storage for sequence state

### Improvements

  - Proactive adaptation: immediate value application on resume and turn-on
  - Schedule/Solar off/on resilience: skip updates while lights are off, force-apply on turn-on
  - Per-preset auto-resume delay (moved from global to per-preset)
  - Turn off light end behavior for dynamic scenes
  - Skip first step in loop for CCT sequences
  - Added Power Nap CCT sequence preset
  - Selective user preset exports
### Bug Fixes

  - Fix Loop N Times count field in Scenes tab
  - Fix Signed URL preset export with selective filtering
  - Fix Preset export using signed URL WebSocket command
  - Fix Auth errors on API calls
  - Fix active presets panel not updating after activation
  - Fix last-half, first-third, last-third keywords to parse_segment_range
  - Fix segment patterns not restoring off state when stopped

### Code Quality

  - Added entity controller test infrastructure
  - Added OverrideAttributes IntFlag and override control mode constant
  - 60+ new tests covering schedule mode, capability detection, override detection, and adaptation

## [0.13.1] - 2026-02-21

### What's New

Version 0.13.1 adds software-interpolated transitions for T1-family devices, optimizes effect attribute write order per device type, and reduces activation timing delays.

### New Features

#### **Software-Interpolated Transitions for T1-Family Devices**

**Smooth CCT and color transitions on T1M and T1 Strip**

T1M and T1 Strip devices don't fully support hardware transitions (T1M has a fixed ~2s transition that ignores requested duration; T1 Strip supports brightness transitions but not color temperature). This release adds software interpolation to simulate smoother longer transitions on these devices.

  - Cubic easing (`ease_in_out_cubic`) for natural-looking transitions
  - Per-device step intervals: T1M minimum 2.0s (hardware smooths between steps), T1 Strip minimum 0.5s
  - Adaptive interval scaling: shorter intervals for quick transitions, longer for extended sequences
  - Interruptible at any sub-step via stop events
  - CCT transitions in both MQTT and ZHA backends
  - XY color transitions in both MQTT and ZHA backends
  - Shared `transition_utils.py` module used by both backends and the scene manager
  - Falls back to direct application if entity is unavailable

### Improvements

#### **Device-Specific Effect Attribute Write Order**

**Optimized MQTT payload and ZCL write order per device type**

  - T2 bulbs: effect type and speed are written before colors (writing speed restarts the effect with default colors, so colors must come last)
  - T1M and T1 Strip: effect type is written first, then colors and speed together (speed is a live adjustment on T1-family, so colors before speed gives faster visual rendering)
  - ZHA backend combines related attributes into single ZCL frames to reduce Zigbee round-trips
  - `DynamicEffect.to_mqtt_payload()` now accepts `device_model` parameter for per-device ordering

#### **Reduced Activation Timing Delays**

  - Light turn-on delay reduced from 0.5s to 0.25s (blocking service call already confirms dispatch)
  - T1 Strip brightness pre-set delay reduced from 0.1s to 0.05s for segment patterns, gradients, and blocks
  - Removed unnecessary `GROUP_SYNC_DELAY` constant
  - Removed inter-group delay between ZHA segment color writes

### Breaking Changes

None. This release is fully backward compatible with v0.13.0.

### Compatibility

- All existing presets, favorites, and configurations preserved
- No configuration changes required
- All previous features and APIs unchanged

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-15

### What's New

Version 0.13.0 adds ZHA backend support as an alternative to Zigbee2MQTT, an image color extractor for dynamic scene presets, T1 Strip audio sync controls, dynamic scene color assignment overrides, and an ignore external changes toggle.

### New Features

#### **ZHA Backend Support**

**Full ZHA integration alongside Zigbee2MQTT**

Use Aqara advanced lighting features through the ZHA integration without requiring Zigbee2MQTT

  - Custom zigpy quirks for each supported device type (T2 bulbs, T1M, T1 Strip)
  - Direct Zigbee cluster attribute writes for effects, segment patterns, and segment sequences
  - Config flow support for quirked ZHA devices
  - ZHA installation instructions added to README

#### **Image Color Extractor**

**Extract colors from images for dynamic scene presets**

  - Upload or link an image to automatically extract a color palette
  - Extracted colors populate directly into the dynamic scene editor

#### **T1 Strip Audio Sync**

**Frontend controls for T1 Strip music synchronization mode**

  - Audio sync toggle, sensitivity, and effect controls in the panel
  - 2 device triggers: music sync enabled, music sync disabled (with sensitivity and audio effect in event data)
  - 1 device condition: music sync is active

#### **Dynamic Scene Color Assignment Override**

**Override color-to-light assignment when activating scenes**

  - Manually assign scene color distribution
  - Brightness activation override for per-scene control

#### **Ignore External Changes Toggle**

**Prevent external changes from pausing running operations**

  - Toggle to ignore external state changes on entities running sequences or scenes
  - Prevents false external pause detection from other automations or manual adjustments

### Improvements

#### **Device Registry Merging**

**Aqara Advanced Lighting devices now share the existing MQTT/ZHA device instead of creating duplicates**

  - The integration now merges into the existing MQTT or ZHA device in the Home Assistant device registry rather than creating a separate device for each light
  - For Z2M: uses shared MQTT identifiers so Home Assistant recognizes both integrations belong to the same physical device
  - For ZHA: uses Zigbee IEEE connection matching for automatic device merging
  - Users see one device per physical light with both integrations listed
  - Old standalone devices from previous versions are automatically removed on upgrade
  - Installing the integration does not affect existing MQTT/ZHA device setups
  - See [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) for upgrade notes on device automations

#### **Unified State Restoration**

**Shared StateManager helper for all operation types**

  - Consolidated state restoration logic into a shared StateManager helper
  - Consistent save/restore behavior across effects, sequences, and scenes
  - Cleaner codebase with reduced duplication

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed auto-fill for new sequence steps** - New CCT and segment sequence steps now auto-fill with the previous step's settings instead of defaults
- **Fixed false external pause detection** - Operations no longer incorrectly detect external changes and pause themselves
- **Fixed deprecated `color_temp` usage** - State restore service calls now use the correct color temperature attribute
- **Fixed tab compatibility detection** - Frontend now uses `device_type` from the backend API for reliable tab compatibility checks
- **Fixed device type dropdown** - Device type dropdown now correctly updates when changing the selected entity
- **Fixed brightness override persistence** - Brightness override setting is now properly stored in user preferences
- **Fixed effects and patterns stopping sequences** - Effects and patterns now call `stop_all_for_entity` to fully stop running sequences instead of pausing and resuming them

### Breaking Changes

#### **Device Automation Re-selection**

**Device triggers and conditions require re-selection after upgrading**

  - The old standalone Aqara Advanced Lighting device is removed during upgrade and replaced by the merged MQTT/ZHA device (see [Improvements](#improvements))
  - **Action required:** If you have device automations (triggers or conditions) targeting the old standalone Aqara Advanced Lighting device, you will need to re-select the device in those automations after upgrading

### Compatibility

- All existing presets, favorites, and configurations preserved
- No configuration changes required
- All previous features and APIs unchanged
- ZHA support works alongside existing Zigbee2MQTT setups
- Device automations using triggers or conditions need device re-selection (see breaking changes above)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-28

### What's New

Version 0.9.0 introduces advanced gradient creation tools, improved color accuracy across the frontend, and a major code modernization converting the segment selector component to TypeScript.

### New Features

#### Advanced Gradient Creation

Five new gradient options in the segment selector's gradient mode:

- **Reverse direction** - Flip the gradient direction with a single toggle
- **Mirror gradient** - Create symmetric patterns (A-B-C-B-A) from your color stops, with correct handling for both odd and even segment counts
- **Interpolation mode selector** - Choose between three color blending methods:
  - Shortest hue path (default) - Interpolates through the shortest arc on the color wheel
  - Longest hue path - Takes the long way around for more colorful transitions
  - Linear RGB - Blends directly in RGB space for different visual results
- **Repeating gradient** - Tile the gradient pattern across segments (1-10 repeats)
- **Wave easing** - Apply sinusoidal easing to color transitions with configurable cycle count (1-5 cycles), creating smooth oscillating patterns

All gradient options work with both "Apply to Grid" and "Apply to Selected" actions, and persist per-step in segment sequence editor.

### Improvements

#### Color Accuracy

- **Improved XY-to-RGB conversion** - Added max-component normalization to the sRGB D65 transformation, fixing washed-out blues and improving color fidelity across the entire color wheel
- **Consistent color conversion** - All frontend components now use shared color utility functions from `color-utils.ts`, eliminating duplicate inline implementations with slightly different behavior

- All 9 service handlers now use _resolve_entity_ids() for group support
- handle_set_dynamic_effect: Uses batch publishing when sync=true and multiple devices
- handle_set_dynamic_effect: Parallel brightness changes using asyncio.gather
- All segment services: Use batch publishing for synchronized group operations

## Breaking Changes

None - This release is fully backward compatible with v0.2.0.

Note: Segment pattern preset values have changed from "t1m_segment_X" to "segment_X". If you have automations or scripts using the old format, update them to the new format.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.12.0 or newer
- MQTT integration configured
- Zigbee2MQTT 2.7.2 or newer
- Supported Aqara devices:
  - T1 Ceiling Light (ACN031) - 20 segments
  - T1M Ceiling Light (ACN032) - 26 segments
  - T1 LED Strip (ACN132) - Variable (5 segments/meter, 1-10m)
  - T2 RGB Bulb (AGL001/AGL003/AGL005/AGL007)

### Upgrade from v0.2.0

1. Update the integration through HACS
2. Reload the integration (Settings > Devices & Services > Aqara Advanced Lighting > Three dots > Reload)
3. Update any automations/scripts using old segment preset format ("t1m_segment_1" to "segment_1")

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-31

## New Features

### Aqara App Presets
- **24 Dynamic Effect Presets** - Quick access to Aqara mobile app's preset effects
  - 4 T2 Bulb presets: Candlelight, Breath, Colorful, Security
  - 9 T1M presets: Dinner, Sunset, Autumn, Galaxy, Daydream, Holiday, Party, Meteor, Alert
  - 7 T1 Strip presets: Rainbow, Heartbeat, Gala, Sea of Flowers, Rhythmic, Exciting, Colorful
  - All accessible via dropdown selector in `set_dynamic_effect` service

### Segment Pattern Presets
- **12 T1M/T1 Strip Segment Presets** - Beautiful segment color patterns from the Aqara app
  - Accessible via dropdown selector in `set_segment_pattern` service
  - Compatible with T1M (20 & 26 segment) and T1 Strip devices
  - Automatically scales to device segment count

### T1 Strip Variable Length Support
- **Automatic Length Detection** - Integration now reads T1 Strip's actual length from Z2M
  - Calculates correct segment count (5 segments per meter)
  - Supports strips from 1-10 meters (5-50 segments)
  - Falls back to 10 segments (2 meters) with warning if length unavailable
  - Affects all segment services: `set_segment_pattern`, `create_gradient`, `create_blocks`

### Brightness Control
- **Brightness Parameter** - Added to effect and all segment services (1-255 range)

## Bug Fixes

### T1 Strip Segment Calculations
- Fixed incorrect hardcoded segment count defaults (was 20/100, now reads actual length)
- Fixed brightness not being applied to T1 Strip segment patterns
- Added `_get_actual_segment_count()` helper function for accurate segment count

### Segment Service Improvements
- Made `segment_colors` parameter optional when using presets
- Made `effect` parameter optional when using presets
- Improved validation and error messages for preset compatibility

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added HACS one-click install button
- Added preset documentation
- Updated all service examples with preset usage
- Added T1 Strip variable length documentation
- Updated troubleshooting guide

### Service Definitions
- Updated `services.yaml` with preset selectors
- Improved parameter descriptions
- Added brightness parameter documentation

## Technical Changes

### Code Structure
- Added `EFFECT_PRESETS` dictionary with 24 preset definitions in `const.py`
- Added `SEGMENT_PATTERN_PRESETS` dictionary with 12 preset definitions in `const.py`
- Added preset constants for all 36 presets
- Added `_get_actual_segment_count()` helper function in `services.py`
- Updated all segment services to use helper function for segment count
- Removed unused brightness field from SegmentColor objects (Z2M doesn't use it)
- Added brightness pre-setting for T1 Strip before segment pattern commands

### Service Handler Updates
- `handle_set_dynamic_effect`: Added preset support with device type validation
- `handle_set_segment_pattern`: Added preset support with automatic color generation
- `handle_create_gradient`: Added proper T1 Strip length detection
- `handle_create_blocks`: Added proper T1 Strip length detection
- All segment services: Set T1 Strip brightness before segment commands with 0.1s delay
