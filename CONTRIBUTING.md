## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow
- Follow Home Assistant community guidelines

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your contribution
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher (for frontend build tools only)
- Home Assistant development environment
- Docker (for HA dev container, optional)
- Git

**Note**: The frontend is built with Lit (TypeScript/web components). Node.js is only used as a build tool to compile and bundle the frontend code. The final output is vanilla JavaScript that runs in the browser.

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Aqara-Advanced-Lighting.git
cd Aqara-Advanced-Lighting

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/frontend_src

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```

### Running in Home Assistant

1. Copy the `custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration through the UI

## Code Contributions

### What to Contribute

We welcome contributions for:

- Bug fixes
- New features for supported light models (T1, T1M, T1 Strip, T2 Bulb)
- Performance improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Code quality improvements
- Test coverage improvements

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Review the existing codebase to understand architecture patterns and code style

### Code Standards

This project follows Home Assistant integration quality standards and best practices.

#### Python Code

- **Python Version**: 3.13+
- **Type Hints**: Required for all functions and methods
- **Formatting**: Use Ruff for formatting
- **Linting**: PyLint and Ruff
- **Type Checking**: MyPy
- **Async**: All I/O operations must be async
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate Home Assistant exceptions
- **Documentation**: Docstrings required for all public methods

Example:
```python
async def async_setup_entry(hass: HomeAssistant, entry: ConfigEntry) -> bool:
    """Set up Aqara Advanced Lighting from a config entry."""
    # Implementation
```

#### TypeScript/Lit Frontend Code

The frontend is built with **Lit** (lightweight web components library) and TypeScript:

- **Framework**: Lit 3.x for web components
- **Language**: TypeScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type checking
- **Formatting**: Follow existing code style
- **Build Output**: Compiles to vanilla JavaScript (no runtime dependencies)
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Follow HA frontend patterns and custom element standards

#### Key Rules

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid over-engineering
- Write tests for new functionality
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Development Commands

```bash
# Backend - Run linters
pre-commit run --all-files

# Backend - Run tests for integration
pytest ./tests/components/aqara_advanced_lighting \
  --cov=homeassistant.components.aqara_advanced_lighting \

npm run build

# Frontend - Development watch mode
npm run watch
```

## Contributing Language Translations

We welcome translations of the integration into other languages. Translations help make the integration accessible to Home Assistant users worldwide.

### What Gets Translated

The integration has two separate translation systems:

1. **Backend Translations** - Service actions, config flow, and exception messages
2. **Frontend Panel Translations** - UI labels, buttons, and tooltips in the Aqara Lighting panel

### Translation File Structure

Translations are stored in two separate locations:

**Backend Translations** (Home Assistant standard):
```
custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/translations/
├── en.json          # English (reference translation)
├── de.json          # German
├── fr.json          # French
├── es.json          # Spanish
└── [language].json  # Your translation
```

**Frontend Panel Translations** (embedded in compiled JavaScript):
```
custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/frontend_src/translations/
├── panel.en.json    # English panel UI (reference)
├── panel.de.json    # German panel UI
├── panel.fr.json    # French panel UI
└── panel.[lang].json  # Your panel translation
```

Each language file uses the ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., `de` for German, `fr` for French, `es` for Spanish).

### Why Two Translation Systems?

Home Assistant's translation API for custom integrations only serves standard sections (config, services, exceptions). Custom UI elements like the panel must embed their translations directly in the compiled JavaScript. This is why panel translations are separate and require a frontend rebuild.

### How to Create a Translation

#### Step 1: Copy the English Templates

You need to translate **both** backend and frontend files:

**Backend Translation:**
```bash
cd custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/translations/
cp en.json [your_language_code].json
```

**Frontend Panel Translation:**
```bash
cd custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/frontend_src/translations/
cp panel.en.json panel.[your_language_code].json
```

For example, to create a German translation:
```bash
# Backend
cd custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/translations/
cp en.json de.json

# Frontend
cd ../frontend_src/translations/
cp panel.en.json panel.de.json
```

#### Step 2: Translate the Content

Open your new translation files and translate all text values while keeping the JSON structure and keys unchanged.

**Backend Translation Structure (en.json):**

```json
{
  "config": {
    "step": {
      "user": {
        "title": "Set up Aqara Advanced Lighting",
        "description": "Configure advanced lighting control for Aqara lights via Zigbee2MQTT.",
        "data": {
          "z2m_base_topic": "Zigbee2MQTT base topic"
        }
      }
    },
    "error": {
      "mqtt_not_loaded": "MQTT integration is not loaded.",
      "unknown": "An unexpected error occurred."
    }
  },
  "services": {
    "set_dynamic_effect": {
      "name": "Set dynamic effect",
      "description": "Activate a dynamic RGB effect on Aqara lights.",
      "fields": {
        "entity_id": {
          "name": "Light entity",
          "description": "The light entity or group to control."
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "exceptions": {
    "device_not_found": {
      "message": "Device {device} was not found."
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend Panel Translation Structure (panel.en.json):**

```json
{
  "title": "Aqara Advanced Lighting",
  "tabs": {
    "activate": "Activate",
    "effects": "Effects",
    "patterns": "Patterns"
  },
  "editors": {
    "name_label": "Name",
    "save_button": "Save",
    "cancel_button": "Cancel"
  }
}
```

**Important Rules:**

- **DO translate**: All text values (strings after the `:`)
- **DO NOT translate**: JSON keys, placeholders like `{device_name}`, or special values like `mdi:icon-name`
- **Preserve structure**: Keep the exact same JSON structure and nesting
- **Maintain placeholders**: Keep placeholders like `{device_name}` exactly as they appear

#### Step 3: Translation Best Practices

**Language Style:**
- Be concise and clear
- Use terminology consistent with Home Assistant in your language
- Avoid emojis or special characters
- Write for non-technical users when possible

**Capitalization Rules:**
- **Dialog/Section Titles**: Use Title Case (capitalize major words)
  - Examples: "Create Effect Preset", "Segment Pattern Presets", "Transition Settings"
- **Field Labels/Service Names**: Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)
  - Examples: "Light entity", "Color temperature", "Set dynamic effect"
- **Descriptions**: Use sentence case
  - Examples: "Select the light device to control", "Brightness level for the effect"

**Context Awareness:**
- Service descriptions should explain what the service does
- Field descriptions should clarify what the user needs to provide
- Error messages should be helpful and actionable

**Good Examples:**

```json
// Dialog title - Title Case
"create_effect_title": "Create Effect Preset"

// Field label - Sentence case
"name": "Effect brightness"

// Description - Sentence case, clear and concise
"description": "Select the light device to control"

// Bad - Too verbose
"description": "This is the field where you need to select which light device you want to control"

// Bad - Wrong capitalization for field label (should be sentence case)
"name": "Effect Brightness"
```

### Complete Translation Sections

**Backend Translation (en.json)** should include:

1. **config** - Configuration flow text (setup wizard and reconfigure flow)
2. **exceptions** - Error messages with placeholders
3. **services** - All service action definitions

8. **transition_curve** - Transition curve editor
9. **tooltips** - Hover tooltips
10. **options** - Dropdown options
11. **editors** - Form field labels and buttons

### Testing Your Translation

#### Step 1: Rebuild the Frontend (Required for Panel Translations)

If you translated the frontend panel (`panel.[lang].json`), you must rebuild the frontend:

```bash
cd custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/frontend_src
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm run build
```

This compiles your panel translations into the JavaScript bundle.

#### Step 2: Copy Translation Files to Home Assistant

**Backend translation:**
```bash
# Copy your backend translation to your HA custom_components folder
cp custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/translations/[language].json \
  /config/custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/translations/
```

**Frontend panel (after rebuild):**
```bash
# Copy the rebuilt frontend with embedded translations
cp custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/frontend/aqara_panel.js \
  /config/custom_components/aqara_advanced_lighting/frontend/
```

#### Step 3: Set Your Language in Home Assistant

- Go to your user profile (click your username)
- Select Language
- Choose your translated language
- Restart Home Assistant to load the new translations

#### Step 4: Test the Translation Appears

**Backend translations:**
- **Configuration Flow**: Try adding the integration (Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration)
- **Services**: Open Developer Tools > Actions and search for "Aqara" services
- **Error Messages**: Trigger errors (try invalid device IDs) to see exception translations

**Frontend panel translations:**
- **Panel UI**: Open the Aqara Lighting panel and check all tabs, buttons, and labels
- **Dialogs**: Open the effect/pattern editors to test dialog translations
- **Tooltips**: Hover over UI elements to verify tooltip translations

#### Step 5: Verify Completeness

- [ ] All service names appear in your language
- [ ] All field descriptions are translated
- [ ] Error messages display in your language
- [ ] Panel UI is fully translated (if applicable)
- [ ] No English text appears where it shouldn't
- [ ] Placeholders like `{device}` remain unchanged

#### Common Issues

**Translation not appearing:**
- Verify the file is named correctly with the ISO 639-1 code
- Check JSON syntax is valid (use a JSON validator)
- Ensure Home Assistant language setting matches your file name
- Restart Home Assistant after adding the translation file

**Partial translation showing:**
- Missing translations fall back to English
- Compare your file structure to `en.json` to find missing keys
- Ensure all nested objects are complete

**JSON syntax errors:**
- Use a JSON validator (many online tools available)
- Common mistakes: missing commas, trailing commas, unescaped quotes
- Validate before submitting

If you maintain a translation, watch for integration updates that might require translation updates.

## Submitting Custom Presets

We welcome community-created presets that showcase creative uses of the lights. High-quality presets may be included as built-in defaults.

### Preset Types

1. **Dynamic Effects** - RGB effects with custom colors and speeds
2. **Segment Patterns** - Individual segment color configurations
3. **CCT Sequences** - Color temperature and brightness sequences
4. **Segment Sequences** - Animated segment sequences with multiple steps

### Preset Submission Guidelines

#### Quality Requirements

- Preset must work reliably on the specified device type(s)
- Should demonstrate a unique or useful lighting pattern
- Must have a clear, descriptive name
- Should include all necessary parameters
- Tested on actual hardware

#### How to Submit Presets

1. Create your preset using the integration UI
2. Export the preset configuration using one of these methods:

**Method 1: Access Storage File (Recommended)**
   - Navigate to your Home Assistant config directory (usually `/config/` or `~/.homeassistant/`)
   - Open `.storage/aqara_advanced_lighting.presets` in a text editor
   - Find your preset by name in the appropriate section:
     - `effect_presets` - Dynamic RGB effects
     - `segment_pattern_presets` - Segment color patterns
     - `cct_sequence_presets` - CCT sequences
     - `segment_sequence_presets` - RGB segment sequences
   - Copy your preset data (including all fields like name, icon, colors, steps, etc.)
   - Note: The storage file is in JSON format with all your user-created presets

**Method 2: Use HTTP API**
   - Open Developer Tools > Actions
   - Create a REST API call (or use curl):
     ```bash
     curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
       http://YOUR_HA_IP:8123/api/aqara_advanced_lighting/user_presets?type=effect
     ```
   - Replace `type=effect` with your preset type: `effect`, `segment_pattern`, `cct_sequence`, or `segment_sequence`
   - Find your preset in the JSON response and copy the preset data

**Method 3: Browser Developer Console**
   - Open the Aqara Lighting panel in your browser
   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to the Network tab
   - Look for requests to `/api/aqara_advanced_lighting/user_presets`
   - View the response to see all your presets
   - Copy your preset data

3. Create a preset submission file in `preset_submissions/` directory:

**File naming**: `preset_type_name.json`

**Example**: `effect_ocean_waves.json`

```json
{
  "preset_type": "effect",
  "name": "Ocean Waves",
  "description": "Gentle blue-green waves reminiscent of ocean water",
  "author": "YourGitHubUsername",
  "device_types": ["t1m", "t1"],
  "tested_on": ["T1M"],
  "icon": "mdi:waves",
  "preset_data": {
    "device_type": "t1m",
    "effect": "flow1",
    "effect_speed": 25,
    "effect_brightness": 80,
    "effect_colors": [
      {"x": 0.1610, "y": 0.3549},
      {"x": 0.1566, "y": 0.2854},
      {"x": 0.1532, "y": 0.2458}
    ]
  }
}
```

4. Submit a pull request with:
   - Your preset file(s) in `preset_submissions/`
   - A brief description of the preset
   - Device type(s) tested on

#### Preset File Format

```json
{
  "preset_type": "effect|segment_pattern|cct_sequence|segment_sequence",
  "name": "Preset Name",
  "description": "Detailed description of what the preset does",
  "author": "GitHub username",
  "device_types": ["t2_bulb", "t1", "t1m", "t1_strip"],
  "tested_on": ["T1M", "T2 Bulb"],
  "icon": "mdi:icon-name",
  "preset_data": {
    // Actual preset configuration data
  }
}
```

#### Preset Naming Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid generic names like "Cool Effect" or "Pattern 1"
- Reference what the preset does or looks like
- Good examples: "Sunset Fade", "Rainbow Chase", "Candlelight Flicker"
- Bad examples: "My Effect", "Test 1", "Cool Pattern"

#### What Makes a Good Preset

- **Unique**: Offers something different from existing presets
- **Purposeful**: Serves a specific use case or aesthetic
- **Polished**: Well-tested with good parameter choices
- **Documented**: Clear description helps users understand when to use it
- **Universal**: Works well across different room sizes/setups when possible
