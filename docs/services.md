  color_2: [0, 0, 255]      # Blue (optional)
  color_3: [0, 255, 0]      # Green (optional)
```

**Parameters:**

- `entity_id` (required): Light entity or group to control
- `preset` (optional): Aqara app preset effect -- dropdown selector with 24 built-in presets. You can also type the name of a custom preset you created in the frontend panel (case-insensitive)
- `effect` (required if no preset): Effect type -- dropdown selector with all available effects

  - `"maintain"`: Keep light at last step's settings
  - `"turn_off"`: Turn off the light
  - `"restore"`: Restore light to its pre-sequence state

**Note:** In standard mode, each step consists of a transition period followed by a hold period. For example, if transition is 2s and hold is 10s, the light will fade for 2s then remain at those settings for 10s before the next step starts. In schedule mode, the integration interpolates between time-based steps on a 24-hour cycle. Sun-relative times (e.g., `sunrise+30`, `sunset-60`) are resolved dynamically using your Home Assistant location. In solar mode, the integration continuously interpolates between the two nearest steps based on the current sun elevation. Both schedule and solar modes poll every 60 seconds and persist across Home Assistant restarts.

data:
  preset: "sunset_glow"
```

**Example (custom scene):**

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.start_dynamic_scene
target:
  entity_id:

## 19. Resume entity control

Resume control of light entities that were paused due to external changes. When you manually change a light that is part of a running dynamic scene, CCT sequence, or segment sequence, the integration pauses control of that individual light. This service resumes control so the light rejoins the running action.

**Service:** `aqara_advanced_lighting.resume_entity_control`

**Example:**

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.resume_entity_control
data:
  entity_id:
    - light.living_room
```

**Parameters:**

- `entity_id` (required): Light entity or entities to resume control for

## 20. Start circadian mode

Start a passive circadian overlay on target lights. Supports two modes:

- **Solar mode** (default): Automatically applies sun-appropriate color temperature and brightness when a light turns on, based on the sun's elevation angle. This is a passive overlay — it applies values on turn-on events and polls periodically, without running a continuous sequence.
- **Schedule mode**: Runs a continuous time-of-day schedule through the CCT sequence manager, interpolating between time-based steps on a 24-hour cycle. Schedule presets (Circadian, Warm Day, Productive Day) use this mode.

**Service:** `aqara_advanced_lighting.start_circadian_mode`

**Example (using a preset):**

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.start_circadian_mode
target:
  entity_id: light.bedroom_ceiling
data:
  preset: "circadian"
```

**Example (custom solar steps):**

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.start_circadian_mode
target:
  entity_id:
    - light.living_room
    - light.kitchen
data:
  solar_steps:
    - sun_elevation: -6
      color_temp: 2700
      brightness: 80
    - sun_elevation: 10
      color_temp: 4000
      brightness: 200
    - sun_elevation: 45
      color_temp: 5500
      brightness: 255
```

**Example (schedule preset with auto-resume):**

Schedule mode presets run a continuous time-of-day schedule. The built-in schedule presets are Circadian Rhythm, Warm Day, and Productive Day — all three use sun-relative times that adapt to seasonal changes:

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.start_circadian_mode
target:
  entity_id:
    - light.living_room
    - light.kitchen
data:
  preset: "circadian"
```

You can also create custom schedule presets in the [CCT sequence editor](visual-editors.md#schedule-mode) (using schedule mode) and use them by name:

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.start_circadian_mode
target:
  entity_id: light.bedroom_ceiling
data:
  preset: "my custom schedule"
```

**Parameters:**

- `entity_id` (required): Light entity or entities to apply circadian mode to
- `preset` (optional): Use a built-in preset ("circadian", "solar_warm", "solar_productive") -- dropdown selector. You can also type the name of a custom CCT sequence preset (case-insensitive). Schedule-mode presets (Circadian Rhythm, Warm Day, Productive Day) are routed through the CCT sequence manager and run continuously, interpolating between time-based steps. Solar-mode presets and custom solar presets use the passive overlay. When preset is selected, manual step parameters are ignored
- `solar_steps` (optional): Custom solar elevation steps for solar mode. Same format as the [start CCT sequence](#6-start-cct-sequence) solar_steps parameter. Requires at least 2 steps

---

## 21. Stop circadian mode

Stop the passive circadian overlay on target lights.

**Service:** `aqara_advanced_lighting.stop_circadian_mode`

**Example:**

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.stop_circadian_mode
target:
  entity_id: light.bedroom_ceiling
```

**Parameters:**

- `entity_id` (required): Light entity or entities to stop circadian mode for

## Working with light groups

All services support Home Assistant light groups. When you target a light group, the integration automatically:

- Detects the group and expands it to individual light entities
- Removes any duplicate entities
- Routes each entity to the correct backend (Z2M or ZHA) automatically
- Applies the effect/pattern to all lights simultaneously

**Multi-backend and multi-instance support:**
Light groups can contain entities from different backends and multiple Zigbee2MQTT instances. The integration automatically:

- Identifies which backend and instance owns each entity
- Routes service calls to the appropriate backend
- Processes all entities in parallel for synchronized effects

**Example -- applying an effect to a group:**

```yaml
service: aqara_advanced_lighting.set_dynamic_effect
target:
  entity_id: light.living_room_group  # Can span Z2M instances and ZHA
data:
  preset: "sunset"
```

**Example -- mixed backend group:**

```yaml
# light.whole_house_group contains:
#   - light.living_room (Zigbee2MQTT)
#   - light.bedroom (Zigbee2MQTT)
#   - light.kitchen (ZHA)
#   - light.garage (zigbee2mqtt_garage instance)

service: aqara_advanced_lighting.set_dynamic_effect
target:
  entity_id: light.whole_house_group
data:
  effect: "breathing"
  speed: 50
  color_1: [255, 100, 0]
  # All lights receive the effect, routed to their respective backends
```

## Custom icons for presets

You can use custom icons with your user presets using the [Custom Icons integration](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-custom_icons).

**Using custom icons:**

1. Install and configure the Custom Icons integration
2. When creating or editing a preset, set the icon field to your custom icon identifier (e.g., `local:my_preset_icon`)
3. Standard MDI icons use the format `mdi:icon-name`, while custom icons use `local:icon-name`
